assoc(obj) â†’ an_array or nil click to toggle source
Searches through the hash comparing obj with the key using ==. Returns the
key-value pair (two elements array) or nil if no match is found. See Array#assoc.

This was the hash method that most interested me as I was reading through trying
to complete this assignment. It made the most sense reading through it, but I couldn't
quite get it to work in the way it said it would.

From what I'm reading, it compares objects with either 'true' or 'false'. If they match
it throws them in an array(?) together. This seemed like the easiest way to go
about this project since we were looking for two items that were identical, but
here I sit banging my damn head up against this project and still haven't finished.
